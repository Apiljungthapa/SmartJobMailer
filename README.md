# ðŸ“§ Cold Mail Generator

The **Cold Mail Generator** is a tool designed for service companies to generate personalized cold emails to potential clients based on job listings extracted from their careers page. This app uses `Groq`, `LangChain`, and `Streamlit` to automate the process of crafting effective cold emails by leveraging job descriptions and matching them with relevant portfolio links.

## Overview

Imagine a scenario where a company is looking to hire for a specific role. Instead of letting the company go through a lengthy hiring process, your business development team can reach out to them with a personalized cold email, proposing your company's services to fill the required role more efficiently. This tool helps generate such emails dynamically by analyzing job listings and highlighting relevant expertise and portfolio projects.
